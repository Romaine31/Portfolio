                Hi! I'm John Romaine Cagubcub, <br/>
                A fresh graduate in the course of <br/>
                Bachelor of Science in Computer Science<br/>
                <br/>
                I've studied the fundamentals of various<br/>
                programming languages: <u>Java, <br/>
                Javascript, HTML, CSS, Python, C#.</u><br/>
                In addition I've recently started studying<br/>
                <u>ReactJS</u> which is this site's Framework.<br/>
                <br/>
                I enjoy learning about more advanced frameworks <br/>
                and advancing my knowledge in the tools that I <br/>
                already know, understanding new ways to <br/>
                implement methods and solve problems using <br/>
                the latest technology.<br/>
                <br/>
                I also like to learn from other developers,<br/>
                whether they're more or less experienced<br/>
                than I am, I believe that everyone<br/>
                is able to formulate different solutions<br/>
                or innovate more efficient methods <br/>
                in approaching many modern problems.
